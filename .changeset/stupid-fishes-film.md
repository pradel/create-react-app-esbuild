ðŸš€ create-react-app 5 is now supported ðŸš€

## Breaking Changes

- Remove the `enableSvgr` and `svgrOptions` options. CRA 5 now supports svgr natively and these options are not needed anymore.
- Drop support for CRA 3 and 4. As many underlying libraries have changed, CRA 4 and 3 are no longer supported. Check the [CRA changelog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v5.0.0) to see what changed.
